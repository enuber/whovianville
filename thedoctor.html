        <h3 class="m-t-3">The Time Lords</h3>
            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>The Doctor is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. The Time Lords held absolute power for around ten million years. There is no clear indicator for how long a Time Lord could live but, it has been suggested that they can survive for Millennia. Each Time Lord is able to regenerate twelve times, giving him thirteen lives. A 90 year old Gallifreyan was still considered to be a child and only after 200 years were they no longer considered to be young. According to Handel, who researched the limited regenerations given to the Time Lords, one could live around 10,000 years before regenerating. </p>
                <p>Similiar to other issues in Doctor Who lore, the lifespan of a Time Lord varies based on its source. The Second Doctor mentioned that Time Lords could "live forever" barring any unforseen accidents. Another time, the Doctor considered himself to be middle-aged at 750 years. Of a couple of the named Time Lords, Quences was killed at age 7,000 and, Professor Chronotis was believed to have become senile around age 12,000. Finally, we see that the Eleventh Doctor showing signs of age on the brink of his death at around 2000 years. Regardless, given the chance to regenerate twelve times, the life span of a Time Lord is still significant.
                </p>
            </div>                
            <div class="col-md-6"> 
                <p>The Time Lords are able to extend another Time Lord's lifespan by granting them a new cycle of regenerations. This is how the Doctor was able to regenerate a thirteenth time. At the behest of Clara Oswald, the Time Lords granted the Doctor a new regenerative cycle in order to save his life and change his personal future in exchange for his part in saving them. This though is unclear whether the cycle given to the Doctor was a single regeneration or a complete set of twelve.</p>
                <p>To this end, as assumed by the Doctor, the last great Time War wiped out the Time Lords and destroyed Gallifrey. However, in a single one time event, all thirteen incarnations of the Doctor came together to place the Time Lords into a pocket universe thus saving them from near extinction. On the fields of Trenzalore, the Time Lords attempted to get the Doctor to release them but failed to get him to do so. Eventually Gallifrey is moved to the end of the universe where the Time Lords proceed to lock the Twelfth Doctor in his confession dial. The Doctor escaped, overthrew the leader Rassilon, saved Clara and once again made his escape in another stolen TARDIS. </p>

            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>The main tool of the Doctor is the sonic screwdriver. It is a multifunctional tool that has gone thru many of its own iterations as it has been both destroyed, modified and, upgraded. Originally the sonic screwdriver was considered to be advanced technology from Gallifrey. This is a bit unclear though as it is alluded too that the Doctor was actually the inventor. Over the course of the series, the device has been replicated as sonic lipstick for Sarah Jane Smith, a sonic blaster used by Captain Jack Harkness, a sonic cane, a sonic probe used by Amelia Pond, sonic sunglasses and, a sonic modulator.</p>

                <p>The sonic screwdriver was introduced in 1968 in the episode <em>Fury From The Deep</em>. For all appearances, it was nothing more than a pen light. In this form, it made only a couple of more appearances until it became an important tool of the third and fourth Doctors. The appearance changed dramatically as well. It looked almost like a small old-style microphone placed on top of a tube that had a sliding portion which activated the screwedriver. This sliding motion was meant to regulate the power and functions of the device. The emitter head, the microphone like piece, was able to be switched out to perform various operations. 
                </p>
                <p>The sonic screwdriver became a crutch though as it solved to many problems the Doctor faced and as such, it was downplayed and, eventually destroyed during the fifth Doctor's reign by a Terileptil in the episode <em>The Visitation.</em> A pivotal moment as, the Doctor was trapped in a cell and, without his go to device had to improvise in a new way. Though the sonic screwdriver made appearances with the sixth and seventh Doctor, it was no longer prominent and, was more like a trusty friend. </p>
                <p>With the eighth Doctor the sonic screwdriver made one of its largest changes in appearance. It appeared to now have a wooden handle and a crystal diode with six prongs around it. This diode and prong look influenced the look of the device when the series resumed almost a decade later. Though he had the sonic screwdriver, it was for the ninth Doctor, the device became more stream lined, smaller, yet more akin to a pen with a glowing blue tip along with it also came the sound effect denoting its use. Its head also became extendible as well. </p>

                <p>The sonic screwdriver is destroyed once again in the first episode featuring the eleventh Doctor entitled, <em>Eleventh Hour</em>. The TARDIS, having been damaged heals itself and, provides a new sonic screwdriver from the console. This version of the screwdriver was taller than its predecessor and, the emitting portion is concealed by four claws that open during extension. The screwdriver has taken heavy damage, and been replaced repeatedly. Being bitten in half by a sky shark and then left behind, being left with the Ganger Doctor, destroyed by Danny Fisher and being burnt out due to overuse. </p>
                <p class="hidden-lg-up">One of the twelfth Doctors sonic screwdrivers was incinerated, one was left with Davros and though ultimately returned, was out of commision and badly beaten up. The Doctor declared himself over the sonic screwdrivers and this is when the appearance of the sonic sunglasses came about. The TARDIS eventually gifts the Doctor with another new sonic screwdriver. The newest iteration has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. It has multiple settings and pitches of sound and is meant to represent the TARDIS.</p>

                <p>The sonic screwdriver has many uses and, its abilities and functions have changed as the series has progressed. Most likely due to the Doctor making modifcations as well as when the screwdriver itself has been replaced. There are some materials that it is useless against including wood and it can't work on deadlock seals. Here are just some of its uses.</p>

                <li>Lock picking</li>
                <li>Burn and cut various substances</li>

                <li>Conduct medical scans</li>    
                <li>Remotely control the TARDIS</li>
                <li>Control the atoms and molecules on a small scale</li>
                <li>Operate all levels of technology and computers</li>

                <li>Disarm robotics</li>
                <li>Scan and classify matter</li>    
                <li>Shatter glass</li>
                <li>Create an acoustic corridor enabling speaking from a distance</li>
                <li>Shocking neural centers of living creatures</li>
                <li>Tighten and lossening screws</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The sonic screwdriver could also be used defensively. According to the tenth Doctor, the device could not be used to wound, maim or kill living things. However, the eigth Doctor mentioned that the device could destroy a Dalek if held against their outter casing. Though it is hard to find the line between offensive and defensive in some cases, the sonic screwdriver was used to destroy the Robot Santas by overloading their sensors. It was also used against the Silence to weaken the power of their electricity. On one hand, the sonic screwdriver was capable of holding off the attack of a creature relying on sound and on the other; it was capable of destroying non-living objects and placing living creatures in perilous situations. Then there was the war Doctor that claimed it was a scientific instrument not a water pistol.</p>

                 <p>Psychic paper in appearance was nothing more than a white card that held special properties. When it was shown to most people, they would see whatever the holder wanted them to. It could also receive messages from those with sufficient psychic abilities regardless of the Doctors current location. The Time Lords could also psychically connect with the paper as well allowing them to send messages to the paper when used by someone else. It was also possible to use the paper to open doors like a keycard would, act as a credit card, or even used to pay bus fare. The tenth Doctor also used the psychic paper as a truth telling device.</p>

                 <p>If the thought sent to the paper was to unbelievable, wavy lines would be displayed instead. If the user was untrained, the paper could also display subconcious facts about the weilder rather than what they wanted it to show. The psychic paper could also not be used on those who lacked imagination or the genius-type. In the later case, William Shakespeare proved to be the first person the Doctor met with a natural immunity to it. It also failed to work on the Saturnynians, vampire-like creatures who more resembled an aquatic creature. The psychic paper also would not work on those whose minds had already been manipulated. The paper also was unreliable when used on civilizations that had yet to invent writing and even if a person was illiterate the paper was still able to convey its message.</p>

            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>The Doctor is a legend throughout the entire universe. The title though an alias as his name is unknown by all but a very few people, is a well-deserved name. He did have at least one doctorate, studied 19th century medicine on Earth, and has frequently shown his medical skills even having modified his sonic screwdriver to do medical scans. However, there are some civilizations that translate the word doctor as warrior. The Doctor was generally a practitioner of non-violent conflict resolution always opting to try for a peaceful resolution but, would defend and turn towards hostility when necessary. He was also considered to be the universe's greatest defender not only saving the cosmos countless times but, more individuals than he would ever be able to count.</p>
                <p>It is a bit ambiguous as to the origins of his alias of the Doctor. In one account, it was a name a group of colonist of the planet Iwa called him and, he simply kept the name. In another accounting, it was the name he introduced himself upon meeting humans for the first time on the moon. According to River Song, she believed he was the original source of the word in several different languages.</p>                
                <p>It was clear that the Doctor had a particular affinity for Earth and the people that live on it. He chose Earth as his place of exile, owned property in Britian and the USA and, even before the apparent destruction of Gallifrey seemed to spend more time here than on his homeworld.</p>                
                <p>Though he defied the Time Lords' non-interfence policy and, was subsequently punished; the Doctor became a hero as he fought for injustice all across the universe. His original intentions of leaving Gallifrey were to have fun while experiencing what the universe had to offer. However, in doing so, he often found himself in the midst of crises that ended with him interfering and saving the planets or people where ever he was. Later we found that some of this was that the TARDIS herself was taking him where he was most needed. </p>
                <p>The ability to regenerate is amongst the most prized abilities of the Time Lords. For the Doctor, the effects of regenerating varied. Sometimes he was able to regain his faculties quickly though, often with erratic behaviours but, more often than not, upon regenerating, he was somewhat incapacitated. In the case of the tenth Doctor, his delaying regeneration in order to visit his former companions resulted in an energy release that was catastrophic for the TARDIS. Also, the tenth Doctor prematurely aborted a regeneration in order to heal himself. The rest of the regenerative energy was put into his hand after he healed the wound from a Dalek and, in so doing stopped a full transformation into another form. Because of this, the eleventh Doctor was the final in his regenerative cycle but, after helping to save Gallifrey, he was given another regenerative cycle. It is unknown if that was a single regeneration or a new series of twelve however.</p>

This Doctor was abrasive, patronising, and cantankerous towards those he traveled with but for the bond he had with his granddaughter Susan, who was his first companion. He was also ruthless when needed both lying and in one instance attempted to kill in order to achieve his goals. Once he began trusting humans, he also began to enjoy traveling with them and, his personality mellowed evolving into a more grandfatherly-type figure.</p>

He was clever at playing his enemies to always be a few steps ahead; being a schemer who would manipulate people for the greater good and on occasion act the fool to allow his abilities to be underestimated. He would often panic when situations were out of control but, he always acted both morally and heroically. Most notably, he was known for carrying around and often playing notes on his recorder. He also carried around a diary for a while attempting to record his travels but, in the long run gave that up.</p>

He could be whimsical and charming accompanied by his broad grin and then intensely brooding and serious. Though housing a darker edge, his moral code is stronger than ever as he had a chance to wipe out the Daleks but chooses to not do so as he would be no better than they are. This is also the first Doctor to refer to his companions as his best friends showing his warmth towards oothers as well. This was especially true with his affinity towards Sarah Jane Smith which was implied to be on deeper level than others he had traveled with. This Doctor was also a fighter as a swordsman, non-lethal weaponry and, not as averse to lethal weaponry when necessary. This incarnation also introduced his enjoyment of jelly babies which other incarnations also have a fondness for.</p>

He was more vulnerable and reserved than his previous incarnations and, often made decisions based on a coin flip. Acting more vulnerable and, using improvisation to solve problems, he was far more human than before. He often wore glasses to make himself appear more clever and, was the first Doctor to go without a sonic screwdriver. His companions were more of team mates and, he was less a leader but a follower giving way to stronger command presences. Fitting with the rest of his persona, he abhorred violence and, for the first time the indecisions were shown to weigh upon his character as well as the consequences of his indecisiveness. He also was willing to make personal sacrifices in order to keep his word which held true to the end when rather than cure himself he sacrificed his life for Peri. </p>

So full of himself, he considered his own incarnation to be the finest yet. He was prone to wild mood swings, manic behaviour and sometimes displayed fatalistic overtones. He was overly confident and, his superiority complex made it seem as though he endured those he came across including his companions. His intellect seemed to be a bit sharper than past incarnations as he was even able to fix the Chameleon Circuit allowing the TARDIS to change to her given surroundings. Though he was arrogant and sometimes glib to those around him, his compassion remained as did his strong moral compass. He was one of the most determined Doctors in his quest to right wrongs. Though he was considered abrasive at times, within the audio plays that went along with the series, his character was much calmer and wittier making it seem as though he were actually far happier than the character he portrayed on screen.</p>

He was somewhat a gamemaster being manipulative and, often his plans were far reaching. He generally was curious, knowledgeable, sometimes exciteable and though his shorter stature, he was very capable of taking control of any situation. Much as the second Doctor did, he was willing to act the fool in order to allow his enemies to understimate him. He was also a performer who used magic tricks, illusions, hypnosis and escape artistry when needed. He often was more concerned with the larger picture missing smaller details and, may have been why he was more secretive with his plans. This Doctor was also absolutely opposed to violence, although he was able to cause unconsciousness with just a touch. Though a master of gadgetry, he regularly talked his enemies into submission. </p>

This incarnation speaks with a Northern accent, wears all black including a leather jacket and lives for the present. He considers his past to be to painful and looks towards his own future. Though a hero in his own right, the Doctor could be brutal, confrontational and inflexible. Much of this can be placed upon the fact that he believed he was the last Time Lord and, he was scarred by the his role in the war. On occasion, he still exhibited a playfulness, made jokes to diffuse tension and, ultimately because of Rose began to heal. Though a short lived incarnation, still a pivotal Doctor as by sacrificing himself to save Rose, he shows his ability to care once again about others and, made some peace with his past.</p>

That said, when faced with conflict, the Doctor was fiercely protective and unforgiving of those that meant to harm others. He was the only Doctor to abort a regeneration considering it to be a form of death and loss of identity. This somewhat went against the grain as he carried on his love of Rose from his previous incarnation. Likely due to the fact that she helped heal some of his past. This incarnation also for a time shunned companionship altogether. When alone, the weight of being the last Time Lord was seen to be more pronounced. After his first regeneation, a separate incaranation referred to as the Meta-Crisis Doctor was born. This one was more human-like with one heart and could age yet not regenerate. This other self also deviated from the Doctors moral code. To this end, the Doctor took him to another Rose in another world so that they could be together. As for himself, the new but same Doctor had some of Donna's mannerisms. He however did maintain the same memories of his original self yet, the difference was that this regeneration was born into battle and more angry. As a result he tries to commit genocide against the Daleks something up to this point the Doctor never would have done and, the fourth Doctor refused to do himself.  </p>

                      <p class="list-inline-item">The eleventh Doctor has been described as an "old man trapped inside a young man's body". Perhaps displayed mainly by his outfit of choice, bow tie, fez on occasion and his coat. His coping mechanism is in travel constantly and thrill-seeking. He was also emotionally unpredictable, calculating, and very out-going. However, as this was to have been his last incarnation, his past was also catching up with him. When necessary he was secretive as it seemed he knew what was coming. Most notable was his battle with the Silence who destroyed his TARDIS causing cracks in time. It is because of this that he formed a familial bond with Amy, Rory and more significantly River Song. The consumption of sadness was evident when he lost Amy forever to the Weeping Angels. Unwilling to travel with anyone, he went thru a period of mourning. Also of significance was his fascination with ultimately his next and last companion Clara. She was entertwined into his time stream and most signficantly showed him his secret incarnation, the War Doctor. The eleventh Doctor was able to retain his memories of what happened allowing him to finally clean his hands of the genocide he thought he had caused and, finally able to let go of this past. This incarnation along with his previous incarnation were the two most human-like Doctors. With all due respect to those that came before, I would say that the eleventh incarnation had the biggest shoes to fill up to this point in the Doctors lore. There is little question that he was able to stand up to the challenge and much of it is because they were both incarnations anyone could relate to. The emotional depth, the relationships they held and nurtured and, the stellar writing that came with Steven Moffat made for easily some of the best Doctor Who to date.  </p>

He has returned to a bit more alien-like and, though still holds to his moral compass while saving people, cares less about being seen as a hero or even being liked by those around him. He has gone back towards his earlier incarnations in which he doesn't quite get human beings and puts up a tough exterior so to speak. He is still an adventurer and has been described as being fiercer, madder and even less reliable than before. Though he is darker, he still shares the same passion, fearlessness and is overall a more complex version of the Doctor. </p>
