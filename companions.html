                    <p class="lead companionDescription">The One Who Made Him Better.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12">
                    <p>Rose was an important companion for a couple of reasons. First, the show being relaunched needed to make a change and, there was none bigger than a companion that was as fleshed out as the Doctor himself. She was the first companion to have a life before the Doctor showed up; a boyfriend, a mom, a job and overall she was a more realistic representation of an average person than had been seen before. Second, the Doctor needed someone even if he didn't see it that way because of the Time War and, his belief that he was the cause. Being at such a low point and to some degree being a war-ravaged Doctor, he needed someone to pick him up and set him right again. This he admits himself in saying of his meta-crisis self... “[he was] born in battle. Full of blood and anger and revenge. Remind you of someone? That's me, when we first met. And you made me better. Now you can do the same for him.” </p>
                    <p>Rose was courageous, had a warm heart, was compassionate and witty. One of the most defining moments for her was becoming the Bad Wolf; "I am the Bad Wolf, I Create Myself." She looked into the heart of the TARDIS, and was imbued with the power of time. In so doing, she was able to save the Doctor, bring Jack Harkness back from the dead, and scattered the words "Bad Wolf" throughout time. This became both a warning sign of danger for the Doctor and, was used to lead Rose back to the Game Station in order to save the Doctor as she had just done.  </p>
                    <p>For all appearances, it does seem as though the Doctor was as much in love with Rose as she was of him. The actual answer will never be known as though she professes his love for him after being sent to a parallel universe, their connection is cut before he can respond. However, he does bring a more human like form of himself back to be with her which suggest they had a special connection and, though as stated above it is because he made her better, she is someone he also can't seem to let go of.</p>

                    <p class="lead companionDescription">The Girl Who Walked The Earth.</p>
                    <p class="lead companionDescription">The One That Made Him Stronger.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12">
                    <p>What sets Martha apart is she is a complete person that knows who she is, what she wants, and understands what she can't have. She didn't need to be "rescued" from a mundane life, rather she was on a path that she was both passionate about and, showed off her intelligence. This carries thru while traveling with the doctor. She is logical while under pressure, resourceful, and has street smarts. She also puts family first none more so telling then on the eve of the apocalypse she takes a teleport machine to see her mother as it is where she wants to be. Having fallen in love with the Doctor and realizing it was an unrequited love she doesn't just pine away but, realizes that she deserves to be same rather than hope things will change. It is ultimately why she chooses to leave as she knows she needs to move on with her life and, she needs to do it for herself. </p>
                    <p>Again, setting her a bit apart, she takes what she learns and ends up working with UNIT. She also briefly works with Torchwood before going out on her own. Though the companions in the newer series of Doctor Who all had some significant role to play, Martha shows she is above companion status and ranks more as an ally like Jack or Sarah. She also isn't afraid to say so, "I spent a lot of time with you, thinking I was second best. But you know what? I am good!" In her final scene, she is seen carrying a really big gun, and she is clearly carving her own place. </p>
                    <p>Martha has several great moments, and contributed in her own way but, likely most important was her walking the earth. When Earth falls into the clutches of the Master, Martha is tasked with spreading the stories of her travels with the Doctor and getitng people to help him when the time came. She did so under the guise of creating a weapon to stop the Doctor and, instead is able to help save the world. Something that wasn't thankless but, that everyone forgot as the year she spent doing so was erased and time reset.</p>

                    <p class="lead companionDescription">The Most Important Woman In The Whole Of Creation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12">
                    <p>Though Donna becomes a tragic figure in the end, that really isn't how she should be remembered. After two companions that held romantic feelings, we were finally given an outspoken, sassy woman who had no interest in the Doctor other than adventuring together. Another intelligent woman, her secretarial skills actually come into play when helping the Doctor discover why the planets have disappeared and, again when she is able to grasp a complicated number system that have been set up by an alien race. One of the best characteristics that she brings with her is her repartee with the Doctor. They constantly go back and forth, witty exchanges, comedic timing, her not being in awe of him, this all plays into such a strong willed and remarkable companion. </p>
                    <p>Not only does she see the Doctor as just another person and, puts him in his place when needed, she does the same in front of the Shadow Proclamation. This is a reoccuring theme for her, whenever she feels like she is being looked down upon as either a person or as a human, she steps up to defend herself. She becomes a stronger and smarter person as she travels with the Doctor. What she brings to the Doctor himself is also important. Donna has faith in him and, shows him humanity. She pulls him away from imminent death with the Racnos, begs him to go back for a family in Pompeii and, when he meets his daughter Jenny, she reminds him how to nurture. In this regard, she may have played a large roll in going from the jaded warrior with a broken heart to a new incarnation that was fun-loving, open to others and willing to make friends even when he knew it would hurt him in the end.</p>
                    <p>It is a bit questionable if the eventuality was prophesied by the Ood when they said "Doctor-Donna-Friend" but; even if it were, until events unfolded there was no way to have actually known. Donna touched the Doctors hand as he was regenerating, he had flowed the rest of his regenerative power into the hand so as to not change his actual appearance. The result was that a new being, referred to as the "meta-crisis" was created. A look alike Doctor that was part human and had aspects of Donnas peronality. While touching his hand, she also transferred Time Lord DNA into herself and, upon being electrocuted, it awoke her mind. Meaning, she was now "Doctor Donna" with the mind of a time lord.</p>
                    <p>With her new found knowledge, she was able to deactivate a reality bomb and helped use the magnetron to bring twenty-six of the planets back to where they belonged. When the magnetron was destroyed by the Supreme Dalek, she helped the Doctor to bring Earth back to its proper place. The overall consequence was that her mind was being overwhelmed as she slowly took on aspects of the Doctor and, the knowledge of the Time Lords was to much for her. To save her, the Doctor is forced to erase her memories and, she is brought home to be taken care of. Still, she is referred to by both Rose and the Doctor as being the most important woman in all of creation.</p>

                    <p class="lead companionDescription">The One He Saved.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12">
                    <p>Amy is unique in that she is the only companion that met the Doctor when she was a child and, ended up traveling with him as a companion. From the get go, she shows her bravery as even as a child, she goes out to investigate the mysterious police box that just appears in her back yard. There she questions the Doctor, invites him into her home and, agrees to go away with him. However, she became the girl who waited as though the Doctor was to return for her in five minutes time, he doesn't return for another twelve years. The effect that has on her is displayed in her character as she seems to challenge what is around her to cause disappoint.</p>
                    <p>When she begins to travel with the Doctor, she is also brave to the point of being reckless, often putting herself into danger just because she is able to. It becomes a study of character as you are left wondering if she is actually brave in the face of fear or fearless as she thinks she has nothing to lose. Her relationship with Rory should also be considered along with this as, though she is engaged, she seems uncomfortable with this. She also seems to keep even him at a distance with no real connection outside of their having grown up together. Her attitude seems to be that her life had been disappointing and, with no family or future, who would really care what happened to her. Her travels with the Doctor, effected him as much as it did her as, she develops a sense of faith, and struggles to become the Amy that makes what originally would have been a profound decision in the end. </p>
                    <p>In watching her travels with the Doctor, there is an underlaying current to her story arch. Many of her interactions with people are based in love, caring for others, in reading and understanding motivations of others yet, she doesn't seem to allow herself to share in these feelings. Perhaps because love requires trust, something she isn't easily able to give. Though maybe a bit superficial of a reason, this shows the impact of how a simple experience as a child can effect the future as well. It is one of the reasons the companions in the relaunched series seem to carry more depth than in the past.</p>
                    <p>Watching Rory is like watching the red shirt guy on Star Trek, you know who is going to get it and, you actually feel bad for him during much of the interactions between them. But, in understanding her character you see that she eventually realizes what is important, that she can accept and have the man she really does love and, at the same time adventure with the Doctor. She does throw herself at the Doctor, has Rory play her brother while infiltrating a school for girls and, as with previous companions you are left wondering if it is another case of companion being in love with the Doctor. But, when faced with the Dream Lord, a manifestation of the Doctor's dark side, given the choice to travel with the Doctor or settling down with Rory, she chooses Rory. It is in this particular episode, <em>Amy's Choice,</em> that she really develops as a person. Though she has been reckless, brave, and in some cases a bad ass woman, it is finally allowing herself to accept hapiness and love that makes her character emotionally deep and, ultimately mature.</p>
                    <p>In traveling with the Doctor, she goes from an Alpha female that does what she wants and, is reintroduced to the magic and awe of what makes children seem so wonderous at times. For children, the world can seem magical and, less inclined to see the reality of what is around you. For her, she somewhat takes the opposite path of most companions already being a strong woman that makes it clear that though she eventualy accepts love, her life doesn't revolve around others but, is controlled by herself. In some regards this also mirrors the Doctors path after the Time Wars. He needs to reclaim the excitement and wonder of adventure.</p>
                    <p>In what is one of the most touching scenes between the Doctor, Rory and Amy; after faking his death, he comes to their door two years later on Christmas. They invite him in to join them and, let him know they had always set a place for him at the dinner table. In this way, they show the Doctor that has family no matter where he may go. It would be remiss to not mention that without the Rory and Amy, there would be no River. River plays such an important part in the life of the Doctor and, is their child. She was conceived in the TARDIS and carries Time Lord DNA making her that much more special. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12">
                    <p>There is no denying that Clara has the most interesting beginning of any companion. Starting off as a mind imprisioned in a Dalek, she is nothing more than the <em>Souffl&eacute; girl</em> and, ends up dying before more can be found out. She reappears as a governess in the Christmas special <em>The Snowmen</em>  and promptly dies again. Reappearing once more, in <em>The Bells of St. John,</em> we finally get the young woman that becomes companion to the Doctor. However, she is still a mystery at that point as she had died twice already. </p>
                    <p>It seems fair to say that no other companion has done as much for the Doctor as Clara. She is able to convince the War Doctor to change his own history and save Gallifrey in a pocket universe instead of destroying it and the Daleks. Though the other incarnations will not know, this alone makes such a huge impact. It allows the Doctor to remain faithful to his code and, of course far more important keeps him from commiting genocide on multiple accounts. Again, when the Doctor inevitably ends up on Tranzalore and, his last regenerative cycle had already been used; it is Clara that convinces the Time Lords through an empassioned plea, somewhat more a demand, to grant the Doctor a new regenerative cycle.</p>
                    <p>As if this wasn't enough, she was the girl born to litterally save the Doctor. While in the Doctor's tomb on Trenzalore she enters his timeline in order to reverse the damage done by the Great Intelligence. This causes her to be shattered into what River refers to as <em>echos</em> that were sent throughout his timeline. These instances of her corrected the damage done but, the original Clara that entered into his timeline was trapped there and, rescued by the Doctor. In her own words, "I don’t know where I am. I just know I’m running. Sometimes it’s like I’ve lived a thousand lives in a thousand places. I’m born, I live, I die. And always, there’s the Doctor. Always, I’m running to save the Doctor, again, and again, and again. And he hardly ever hears me. But I’ve always been there." </p>
                    <p>After the death of Danny Pink, a fellow teacher that she fell in love with, Clara became less attached to Eartha and, more reckless in her choices. That recklessness, eventually catches up to her when trying to prove Rigsy's innocence of murder, she takes a Chronolock that brands her for death. This is something that can not be undone and, she dies as a result. The Doctor isn't willing to accept this so he extracts her from her fixed point of death in an attempt to save her. Upon coming to the end of the universe, he finds Ashildr and, comes to realize that he had broken all of his own rules to save Clara. He killed a fellow Time Lord, though she regenerates, steals another TARDIS, and accepts the possibility that the hybrid of prophesy may not be one person but two. Understanding that things can not continue for fear of destruction, the Doctor plans to erase Clara's memories but it ends up that he loses his own memories of her.  </p>
                    <p>In the end, instead of a retread of Donna's story, Clara gets her own story with her own ending. She is a Doctor in her own right and, has a TARDIS as well as a companion in Ashildr to travel with. She knows that she is frozen in time, she has no pulse, and the Doctor didn't actually change the past. She accepts that she has to return to Gallifrey at the moment of her death but, she is choosing to take the long way around and see what else is out there before doing so. </p>

                        <p class="list-inline-item">Rory is touched by a Weeping Angel and sent back to a 1930s version of New York. Tracked by the Doctor, Amy and River it turns out he is an "battery farm" of sorts and, is repeatedly being attacked, sending him back through time and space, while feeding off the time energy created. It is a trap where the Weeping Angels keep people until they die of old age. As he encounters an older version of himself, the Doctor warns that fate has been sealed. In attempt to rectify this, Rory and Amy jump off the roof of the building which creates a paradox as he can't be dead and end up an old man dying in the building below. Having survived the paradox, he ends up touched by a surviving Weeping Angel and sent to the past. Because of the paradox created, the Doctor is unable to retrieve him. </p>

The Doctor won't accept this so tries to cheat death by extracting her from her own fixed point of death. Losing all physical qualties, he brings Clara to the end of time where only Ashildr remains in attempt to restore her completely. For the sake of the universe the Doctor's memory is wiped of Clara. He is returned to his TARDIS and, Clara goes off with Ashildr in their own TARDIS with a promise that she will return to Gallifrey some day to face her death as has been recorded.   </p>
